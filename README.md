# Image Processing with Python

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate fundamental concepts and techniques in **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** using Python. Each notebook corresponds to a specific program or experiment commonly included in undergraduate-level image processing courses.
There is a file `Frequency_domain_filter.m` for Image processing in MATLAB.
## Technologies Used

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
